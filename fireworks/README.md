As a first assignment, we want to celebrate the beginning of your journey into Scala with fireworks!

Your task consists of implementing the trajectory of fireworks particles.

## Overview

In this assignment, you will implement a simple model for simulating fireworks.

A firework can be in one of the following phases (in the following order):

- **Waiting** to be launched: the firework is not yet visible,
- **Launched**: we see one particle going upwards,
- **Exploding**: we see dozens of particles moving in an explosion,
- **Done**: the particles have all burnt.

We model this in Scala with a sealed trait **Firework**, which is extended by the case classes **Waiting**, **Launched**, and **Exploding** and the case object **Done**.

The classes that model each phase of the firework have a method **next** that computes the next state of a firework. Your task is to implement them so that at the end of the assignment you can appreciate the show!

## Open the Project

Download the [handout archive](https://moocs.scala-lang.org/~dockermoocs/handouts/scala-3/fireworks.zip), extract it somewhere on your file system, and open the directory *fireworks* in your code editor.

In case you use IntelliJ, go to menu “File”, click “Open…”, select the directory “fireworks” where you extracted the archive, and click OK. IntelliJ should open the project and analyze its structure in the background.

In case you use Metals with VS Code, go to menu “File”, click “Open Folder…”, select the directory “fireworks” where you extracted the archive and click OK. Metals should show a notification saying “New sbt workspace detected, would you like to import the build?”, click “Import build”.

Open the file `src/main/scala/fireworks/Fireworks.scala`.

## Fill in the Blanks

As you can see, the project is already partially implemented. However, there are still unimplemented parts.

In Scala, we use the symbol **???** as a placeholder for an unimplemented part. So, what you have to do is to read the file `Fireworks.scala`, and replace the occurrences of **???** with proper implementations. Note: don’t change the existing definitions, only replace the **???** with proper expressions. If you change the signature of a method, the grader might not work anymore and you will fail the assignment.

## Run the Tests

At any point, you can run the tests to follow your progress.

With IntelliJ, click on the green arrow in the left margin, in front of the class definition **FireworksSuite**, in the file `src/test/scala/fireworks/FireworksSuite.scala`.

With Metals and VS Code, open the file `src/test/scala/fireworks/FireworksSuite.scala` and click “test” just above the class definition **FireworksSuite**.

## Run the Program

Eventually, when you have finished implementing the project and all the tests pass, run it and enjoy the show!

With IntelliJ, click on the green arrow in the left margin, in front of the definition **@main def main(): Unit**, in the file `src/main/scala/fireworks/Fireworks.scala`, and click on “Run 'Main'”.

With Metals and VS Code, open the file `src/main/scala/firework/FireworksRunner.scala` and click “run” above the definition **@main def main(): Unit**.

## Submit Your Solution

When you are happy with your work, you can submit it to the platform and get a grade. You will have to use the command-line tool [sbt](https://scala-sbt.org) to perform the submission.

Open a terminal (a.k.a. a command prompt) in the project root directory. Run the command **sbt**:

```bash
# This is the command prompt of the operating system
cd /path/to/fireworks
sbt
```

**Note**: make sure you run `sbt` in the root directory of the project (where the file *build.sbt* is).

Sbt should start its own command prompt:

```bash
[info] welcome to sbt 1.4.1 (Oracle Corporation Java 11.0.6)
[info] loading global plugins from /home/julien/.sbt/1.0/plugins
[info] loading settings for project fireworks-build from plugins.sbt,buildSettings.sbt ...
[info] loading project definition from /tmp/fireworks/project
[info] Compiling 2 Scala sources to /tmp/fireworks/project/target/scala-2.12/sbt-1.0/classes ...
[info] loading settings for project fireworks from assignment.sbt,build.sbt ...
[info] set current project to effective-scala-fireworks (in build file:/tmp/fireworks/)
[info] sbt server started at local:///home/julien/.sbt/1.0/server/b541c2ba3b1ae1c9c5ee/sock
sbt:effective-scala-fireworks>
```

Invoke the **submit** task to submit your work. The task takes two arguments: your Coursera e-mail address, and the submission token.

**Note**: the submission token is **not your login password**. Instead, it’s a special password generated by Coursera for every assignment. You can find your submission token at https://coursera.org/learn/effective-scala, then “Week 1”, and “Programming Assignment: Fireworks” (or “Practice Programming Assignment: Fireworks (audit version)” for audit learners).

```bash
effective-scala-fireworks> submit julien.richard-foy@epfl.ch IcGlzUh76GJ94Mlu
```

You should see an output like the following:

```bash
[info] Attempting to submit "fireworks" assignment in "effective-scala" course
[info] Using:
[info] - email: julien@richard-foy.fr
[info] - submit token: IcGlzUh76GJ94Mlu

[info] or (for premium learners):

```

Click on the link in the output to see your grade.

Alternatively, you can also submit your work without starting the sbt command prompt, by running the following command from the operating system terminal:

```bash
sbt "submit julien.richard-foy@epfl.ch IcGlzUh76GJ94Mlu"
```

Note the usage of double-quotes.
